# Evaluating conditions

+ `==`* it’s mean is the values equal to each other as it’s appear without looking to the data type*
+ `===` *is the comparison equal each other and has the same class of data type.*
+ `!==` check if the values are not the same in values and data type
+ `!=` this variable dosent equal to the other value or variable  

# Comparsion operator

+ `<` *variable smaller than*
+ `>`*variable greater than*
+ `<=` *variable smaller than or equal*
+ `>=` *variable greater than or equal*

# Logical condition
***compare the value of true and fulse abd there are three types:***
+ `&&` *(and) give true if the two parts of comparision give true only*
+ `||` *(or) give true if the on part of comparision give true at least*
+ `! ` *(not ) it change true to fulse and vice versa is true*

# Loops
***
Check if the condition returns true ,a code block will run and repeate running util we have fales ,to make loops there are three main condition:
***
+ **For** :*if you need to run something for certain numbers of times `{ for( var i=0;i<10;i++){ document.write(i); }` so it’s contain inlization and condition and update
*
+ **While** : *use it if the irritation time unknown and the condition located at the top of loop*.
+ **while do** : *like the while loop but the condition located at the bottom of loop and this is the structure of it.*
```
 do {
   statement(s);
} while( condition );
```
