# Java script 

***Is a software help us to make webpages more interactive and access content and modify it and for sure to work with java.s you must know the role of programming using it so it hep us to make reaction on website with our clinet.
Any thing needs to deals with clicks and taking actions of certain events we do it by java.s like games /elctronic surves/ etc***

*so java contain scripts : a script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.*

_write scripts v  To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it._
**So scripts help us to sovle hard problems /steps of it:**
* __DEFINE THE GOAL( what I want to achieve)__
* __DESIGN THE SCRIPT (what task are included amd organize them in the line redaged to who depend on who)__
* __CODE EACH STEP: (SKETCHING OUT THE TASKS IN A FLOWCHART)__

**And the rules for naming variables are :**

1. *name cant start with numbers but can start with lestters/$/_*
2. *formating name of letters/numbers/$/_ but you cant put . /-*
3. *you cant use reserved words as names ( keywords or reserved words:are special words that tell the )interpreter to do something*
4.* names sistive to upper/lower case*
5. *meaningful that discrine the information type.*
6. *to distinguish words you must put upper latter at the biganing of  words (FirstNames)*

**ARRAYS** _An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values,Any name that have more than on value ,An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of __expressions:__.
_
- _EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE : var color = 'beige';_
- _EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUe: var area = 3 * 2;_

__OPERATORS__

_they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
_
- **ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS** Assign a value to a variable    color = 'beige';
- **ARITHMETIC OPERATORS** Perform basic math    area = 3 * 2;

- **COMPARISON OPERATORS** Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se      buy = 3 > 5;
- **OGICAL OPERATORS** Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se     buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);
- **STRING OPERATORS** Combine two strings      greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';

**STRING OPERATOR**

_There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
Programmers call the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string concatenation._




__WHAT IS A FUNCTION?__ 
_Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)_

__Calling__ :*ask to perform a task*
__Parameters__ :*pieces of info passd to a function*
__Return value__ : *expected outpot from function return*

*So we can call the fuction  by putting the the function name  at the end
And you can put values and variables in the paranthices ,values called argument,variables called paramenters *

_Also we can save the function result of arguments  or parameter at a new (var)
_
