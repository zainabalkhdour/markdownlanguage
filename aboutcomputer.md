# information about your computer

*Because of computer is everywhere and surrounding us all the time regardless of the size or what we use it for, as you interested in software development you should know how this computer assembled  `(physical parts)` and how these part collaborative with the soft wares, also you should know how the information presented between the parts through electrical signals and on and off control the speed, so now circuits help to develop virtual fiction world, and you must know the software is the mind and the physical is the body.*

 *so the computer has been built to help us as tool facilitate divers range of works that have been done manually for so long `(now rest people and live luxury)` so they the computer is a thinking machine do four main tasks `(input/storage/processing/output)`, so there’s a history for computers too like other things in life , it was a huge computer made of metal and continue to develop until it become small and light of the form of laptops and phones ,etc…, input come from what we try to inter into device through different electric tools, storage information in memory & process happen in the processor using algorithms `(series of command)` and then sent to memory to save it and happen over and over until the output ready, what output can we display depend on the physical part which will present it, our output could be input for others ,and the development contain…*

*computer work actually with 1 & 0 but today we don’t deal with it directly , the computer from inside felled up with circuits and wires that carry the information in the computer and electricity help in that through on off signals fellow in wires and on off represent a bit the smallest information the computer can store so more wires it’s mean more information, binary system is the count system in computer constructed from 0&1 and other type of information even photos represented with numbers and numbers represented with binary system  0&1 `(computer language 0&1)` you can be shocked but sound represented with 0&1 two through graphic map of sound power that expressed with 0&1 `( it’s all 0&1 eventually )`*
